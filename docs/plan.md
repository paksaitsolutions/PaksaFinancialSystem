# Paksa Financial System - Project Plan

## Project Overview
The Paksa Financial System is a comprehensive, AI-accelerated financial management platform designed to streamline financial operations, ensure compliance, and provide actionable insights for organizations. The system is built with a microservices architecture, focusing on security, scalability, and user experience.

## I. Core Financial Modules
- **General Ledger (GL)**: Chart of Accounts, journal entries, multi-currency, budgeting, consolidation.
- **Accounts Payable (AP)**: Invoice management, three-way matching, payment workflows, vendor management.
- **Accounts Receivable (AR)**: Customer invoicing, payment processing, dispute management, dunning.
- **Cash Management**: Real-time cash positioning, forecasting, automated bank reconciliation.
- **Fixed Assets**: Asset lifecycle management, depreciation, maintenance, reporting.
- **Payroll**: Automated wage/deduction calculation, tax filings, benefits management, self-service portal.

## II. Cross-Cutting & System-Wide Modules
- **Business Intelligence (BI) & Reporting**: Customizable dashboards, KPI tracking, advanced data visualization.
- **AI & Machine Learning Integration**: Anomaly detection, predictive forecasting, smart recommendations.
- **Security & Internal Controls**: Data encryption, RBAC, MFA, audit trails, SoD enforcement.
- **Compliance Management**: Support for SOX, PCI DSS, GDPR, and other regulations.
- **System Administration & Settings**: Company profile, user/role management, approval workflows.
- **Audit & Logging**: Comprehensive, immutable audit trails for all system activities.

## III. Extended Financial & Operational Modules
- **Project Accounting**: Project profitability, budget/expense tracking, time tracking.
- **Inventory Management**: Real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking, warehouse integration.
- **Procurement**: Requisition management, purchase order handling, contract management.
- **Treasury Management**: Financial risk management (FX, interest rate), investment/debt tracking.
- **Document Management System (DMS)**: Centralized/secure document storage, OCR search, e-signature.
- **Advanced Financial Reporting & Consolidation**: Financial statement consolidation, M&A accounting, segment reporting.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Framework**: FastAPI for RESTful APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy Core (primary), Django ORM (where applicable)
- **Authentication**: JWT with OAuth2
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **Search**: Elasticsearch

### Frontend (Future Phase)
- React.js with TypeScript
- Material-UI components
- Redux for state management
- Chart.js for data visualization

### DevOps
- Docker and Docker Compose
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Logging with ELK Stack

- Redis
- RabbitMQ
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend development)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env`)
