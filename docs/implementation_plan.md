## Development Approach

1. **Incremental Development**: Build one module at a time
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
3. **Code Reviews**: All changes must be reviewed
4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date
5. **Security First**: Implement security at every layer

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment
2. Initialize database with security policies
3. Implement core models and base classes
4. Begin with General Ledger module

## Success Metrics

- 100% test coverage for core financial logic
- Sub-100ms response time for 95% of API calls
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- 99.9% system availability
- Full compliance with financial regulations
