## Component Architecture

### PrimeVue Components Used
- `Card` - For content containers
- `DataTable` - For data display with sorting/pagination
- `InputText` - For text input fields
- `InputNumber` - For currency and numeric inputs
- `Dropdown` - For selection fields
- `Calendar` - For date selection
- `Textarea` - For multi-line text input
- `Button` - For actions and navigation
- `Tag` - For status and type indicators
- `Chart` - For data visualization
- `Dialog` - For modal interactions

### Layout System
- PrimeFlex grid system (`grid`, `col-12`, `md:col-6`, etc.)
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Proper spacing and alignment utilities
- Consistent component sizing and styling

## Database Schema

### Budgets Table
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- name (String, Required)
- amount (Decimal, Required)
- type (Enum: OPERATIONAL, CAPITAL, PROJECT, DEPARTMENT)

## Testing Recommendations

### Frontend Testing
1. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
2. Validate form submission with various input combinations
3. Test DataTable functionality (sorting, pagination, filtering)
4. Verify toast notifications and error handling
5. Test budget creation and editing workflows

### Backend Testing
1. Test all API endpoints with valid and invalid data
2. Verify database constraints and relationships
3. Test approval workflow state transitions
4. Validate filtering and pagination functionality
5. Test error handling and edge cases

### Integration Testing
1. Test complete budget lifecycle (create → submit → approve)
2. Verify data consistency between frontend and backend
3. Test concurrent user scenarios
4. Validate performance with large datasets

## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend
- Lazy loading of components and routes
- Efficient state management with Pinia
- Optimized re-rendering with computed properties
- Proper component lifecycle management

### Backend
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient pagination with offset/limit
- Optimized SQL queries with proper joins
- Connection pooling and query optimization

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API endpoint protection with user verification
- Secure token refresh mechanism

### Data Validation
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection with proper data sanitization
- CSRF protection with proper headers
